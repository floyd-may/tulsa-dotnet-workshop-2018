# Tulsa .Net Development Workshop - August 2018

This is the web application we built in the .Net Workshop on 8-24-2018.
As a reminder, you'll need to have a personal access token configured in Github, and set up in `appsettings.Development.json`.
Typically, `appsettings.Development.json` isn't a file you should put into source control, but I left it here so that you could
get started easily.

From the `dominion-web` folder, run `dotnet run` to start the webserver, or `dotnet watch run` to rebuild and restart the server
anytime you make changes to the C# files.

Run tests using `dotnet watch test` in the `dominion-tests` folder.
